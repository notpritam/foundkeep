# Public video downloader runtime

`downloadCustomerRemoteMedia(sourceUrl, options)` in `apps/backend/src/customer-remote-media.ts` downloads one public source into a disposable local MP4. It is a callable boundary only: the caller owns processing consent, accounting, durable owner-scoped storage, cancellation on edit/delete, and presentation. It never changes a database or substitutes a transient media CDN URL for the original source.

## Installation

The operator must install a separate Python virtual environment with **yt-dlp 2026.8.19**, without optional dependencies, and explicitly set:

```sh
FOUNDKEEP_MEDIA_PYTHON=/home/pritam/.local/share/foundkeep-media-runtime/yt-dlp-2026.8.19/bin/python
```

The environment is already installed on the development host. For a fresh host, the equivalent installation is:

```sh
python3 -m venv /home/pritam/.local/share/foundkeep-media-runtime/yt-dlp-2026.8.19
/home/pritam/.local/share/foundkeep-media-runtime/yt-dlp-2026.8.19/bin/python -m pip install --no-deps 'yt-dlp==2026.8.19'
```

Python 3.10+ on Linux, `/usr/bin/prlimit`, and `/usr/bin/ffprobe` are required. The path is operator configuration; request input cannot choose an executable, script, downloader arguments, output path, or environment. The module returns `unavailable` when no absolute Python runtime path is configured. The helper rejects a different yt-dlp version for platform extraction. Ship `apps/backend/scripts/customer-remote-media.py` alongside the backend; its path is resolved relative to the TypeScript module. Do not enable production until separate integration and dev verification are complete.

The implementation follows the [yt-dlp embedding and format-selection documentation](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#embedding-yt-dlp) and is pinned to the [2026.08.19 release](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2026.08.19). Upgrade only with the focused tests and a fresh live platform check, because the request-handler/plugin internals are version-specific.

## Result and cleanup contract

```ts
const result = await downloadCustomerRemoteMedia(sourceUrl, { signal });
if (result.status === 'downloaded') {
  try {
    // Copy result.absolutePath into existing owner-scoped customer-file storage.
    // Preserve result.sourceUrl as the source evidence.
  } finally {
    await result.dispose();
  }
}
```

A successful result includes:

- `absolutePath`: private temporary local file; valid until `dispose()`.
- `sourceUrl`: validated original source, with fragment removed. Never the extracted CDN URL.
- `mime: 'video/mp4'`, actual `bytes`, `sha256` encoded as **base64url**, and probed `durationSeconds`.
- Bounded plain-text `title`, `description`, `author`; these are untrusted source metadata.
- Up to two available VTT subtitle evidence objects (`language`, `automatic`, `text`). Missing subtitles produce an empty array. Automatic platform captions are labelled; no transcript is inferred or generated.
- Idempotent asynchronous `dispose()`, which removes the entire temporary directory.

Failure statuses are `unavailable`, `unsupported`, `too_large`, `cancelled`, `timeout`, or `error`, with a fixed safe `reason`. Extractor errors, signed CDN URLs and raw stderr are not returned. Every unsuccessful path removes temporary artifacts after its subprocess exits. The caller must always dispose success, including failed persistence and cancelled owner operations. This temporary file is not durable storage or a completed save.

Options can only lower the hard limits: 50 MiB file size, 30-minute duration, and 120-second total deadline. A real local ffprobe verifies MP4 structure, H.264 video, optional AAC audio, positive bounded duration and dimensions up to 4096. Missing, empty, malformed, oversized or symlink output is rejected. This validates the container and stream metadata; it does not decode every frame.

## Network and execution boundary

Python runs with `-I`, an allowlisted environment, private temporary HOME/config/cache directories, and no inherited secrets or proxies. The embedded API bypasses CLI configuration. Plugins, cache, browser cookies, cookie files, netrc, remote components, JS runtimes, external downloaders and postprocessors are disabled. Only the stdlib urllib yt-dlp request handler is installed. These restrictions are enforced, including subprocess rejection, rather than relying on CLI defaults.

A permanent [Python audit hook](https://docs.python.org/3/library/audit_events.html) checks the actual numeric destination of every socket connection. It permits only TCP to public IPv4 or global IPv6 addresses on HTTP(S) ports; it rejects Unix sockets, UDP/raw sockets, hostname-based connects, private/metadata addresses, mapped/transition/special IPv6 and socket listening. DNS results are checked in full, including mixed public/private answers, and the actual address is checked again at connection time, preventing DNS rebinding. Address ranges mirror `customer-preview.ts`. Normal system DNS resolution is permitted; it grants no permission to connect to a returned private address.

Initial requests, redirects, CDN requests, format lookups and subtitle requests all remain in this guarded process. URL checks reject non-HTTP(S) protocols and embedded credentials. A failed boundary check never falls back to an unguarded HTTP client, proxy, native transport or executable. The guard assumes the pinned Python/yt-dlp code is trusted; it is not a general sandbox for arbitrary malicious Python code. Do not install third-party request handlers or plugins into this runtime.

Direct and platform HTTP responses share per-download 100 MiB limits for wire-body bytes and decoded-body bytes, plus a 100-request budget. An early response handler runs before redirects, HTTP-error processing and yt-dlp decompression, so redirect drains and extractor-consumed error bodies count too. Gzip and zlib/raw deflate are decoded incrementally under the decoded limit; identity responses are supported and other content encodings fail closed. Normal decompression removes the original compressed Content-Length so saved-file size checks use the actual decoded bytes. The helper limits virtual memory to 768 MiB, CPU to 60 seconds, file size to the caller's bounded maximum and file descriptors to 64; one fixed video file is written, without sidecars. Subtitles are individually capped at 32 KiB. Parent cancellation/deadline kills the entire process group and waits for it before cleanup. Probe CPU/memory/output are separately bounded. ffprobe uses only the MOV demuxer, disables external MOV data references, and permits only the local `file` protocol under the [FFmpeg protocol whitelist](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-protocols.html#Protocol-Options), so media cannot trigger decoder network access.

## Current platform limits

Public Instagram, X/Twitter and YouTube sources are passed to their real yt-dlp extractors. Direct public `.mp4` URLs use the guarded streaming HTTP implementation. Other direct URLs can be detected by yt-dlp from their response type. A progressive HTTP(S) MP4 takes precedence; otherwise a compatible H.264 video/AAC audio pair is downloaded and muxed locally. Format selection prefers the highest compatible H.264/AAC picture up to a 720p short edge (including portrait video). If only larger formats exist it chooses the closest above that target. Declared sizes and yt-dlp estimates derived from bitrate and source duration must fit the byte budget; a smaller eligible format is chosen when a larger one exceeds it. If every compatible candidate is oversized, the result is `too_large`. Unknown codec metadata is allowed for direct media, with ffprobe providing the final check. A complete silent H.264 MP4 is also eligible when source formats contain no audio evidence and the candidate has no adaptive manifest/fragment evidence; an audio-less adaptive track is excluded when a separate audio or combined representation exists. Unknown-size formats remain eligible by quality; their size cannot be guaranteed until streaming finishes, and the hard byte limit still applies. No successful download is claimed if that limit is crossed. Playlists, live/upcoming streams, fragment manifests, DRM, unsupported codecs and files outside limits are rejected. Explicit operator session jars can be used through the existing scoped cookie path; no anti-bot bypass is attempted.

This stage intentionally has no JavaScript runtime. [YouTube's current EJS requirements](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/EJS) mean many public YouTube videos will remain unavailable, as will sources offering only HLS or fragmented DASH media. Availability must be measured with real samples; this boundary does not establish friends-beta platform completeness. The local stream-copy mux now handles complete HTTP video/audio tracks; confined JavaScript remains outside this boundary.

## Verification

```sh
bun test apps/backend/test/customer-remote-media.test.ts
/home/pritam/.local/share/foundkeep-media-runtime/yt-dlp-2026.8.19/bin/python apps/backend/scripts/test_customer_remote_media.py
bunx tsc --noEmit -p apps/backend/tsconfig.json
```

The Bun tests use a real synthetic MP4 and ffprobe, exercise cleanup and malformed outputs, and kill real timed/cancelled Python processes. Python tests exercise actual audit events, mixed/rebound DNS, redirects, byte budgets, and the real pinned yt-dlp parser with only HTTP transport replaced by a deterministic fixture. A malicious local config/plugin fixture must not execute. A realistic multi-format fixture exercises the pinned yt-dlp format parser, verifies 720p preference, smaller budget fallbacks, bitrate-duration estimates, incompatible codecs/adaptive video-only exclusion, silent-original support and unknown-size handling. Real direct/yt-dlp opener regressions exercise oversized redirect, HTTP-error and compressed bodies as well as ordinary redirects and gzip/deflate decoding. Live public platform checks are a separate root-owned release gate.

## Processing, private playback and restart cleanup

**Twitter update (1.7.8):** New X post saves use the independent preservation queue described in [twitter-preservation.md](twitter-preservation.md). It copies the selected post's own photos/videos and readable linked article text on Free or Pro within storage quotas, without an AI credit. The managed-processing path below continues to govern other sources and optional AI work. The orphan sweeper also checks `customer_media_assets` references before removing remote files.

The managed-processing worker integrates this boundary with the enabled processing feature, explicit public-link consent, optional separate image consent, instant/scheduled/manual/paused modes and the user's monthly credit cap. During [MCP early access](mcp-parity.md), processing is enabled on both Free and Pro. It retains the original source URL and stores validated video bytes under the owner's private save. Cookie and mobile-token file endpoints support authenticated byte ranges for playback and seeking. Other accounts cannot read the saved file.

One successfully preserved video consumes one processing credit, including a media-only result with no readable text. That result preserves the user's existing organization and does not invent a transcript or call AI. When actual text or a consented frame is available, the AI receives that selected evidence plus a separate statement of whether the original file was preserved. A rejected download with no usable source evidence consumes no credit. A source failure cannot be reported as a successfully downloaded video.

File attachment, processing results and credit settlement commit together after rechecking consent, ownership, quota, source revision and the active job lease. Cancellation, editing, deletion, quota failure and provider failure remove uncommitted files. Completed fingerprints include the attached file so retrying the same completed save cannot spend another credit.

The remote namespace is `customer-files/remote/.tmp` during staging and `customer-files/remote/YYYY-MM/UUID` for final files. A bounded rotating sweep checks at most 100 entries per pass, after restart and at most once per minute. It removes only unreferenced regular remote files older than one hour, under a database reference check. Existing uploads, referenced/fresh files, symlinks and nonconforming paths are protected.

The Linux service must additionally isolate extractor scratch files across service lifetimes:

```ini
[Service]
PrivateTmp=yes
KillMode=control-group
Environment=FOUNDKEEP_MEDIA_PYTHON=/home/pritam/.local/share/foundkeep-media-runtime/yt-dlp-2026.8.19/bin/python
```

A transient service with these settings successfully downloaded and validated a real public MP4 on the host. Its scratch directory was invisible in the host's `/tmp`, visible only in its mount namespace, and removed when the service stopped. Normal per-download disposal still runs; the dedicated database-aware sweep handles durable staging left by a crash. Do not sweep unrelated host temporary directories.

## September 20: operator session monitoring and split tracks

The backend now checks configured social sessions two minutes after startup and every six hours using the guarded resolver. `/console/sessions` shows per-platform availability, check times and fixed safe reasons. `/api/admin/social-sessions` requires the existing admin authorization and never returns cookie values or paths. `probes.json` in the session directory can override the public post used for each platform; entries must resolve to that same platform. Missing session files are not probed. Replacing a cookie file clears its in-memory cooldown on reload.

Login/denial expires immediately; two consecutive other failures require attention. Cooldown does not count as failure. A successful public response confirms availability but does not prove the cookie was needed. Missing or removed probe posts may require changing the target instead of the cookie. Push alerts go only to opted-in, unexpired devices belonging to the admin email allowlist. Failed delivery retries on the next pass; accepted alerts are throttled for twelve hours between expiry transitions, with recovery resetting the throttle.

The extractor can now select separate H.264 MP4 video and AAC M4A audio over ordinary HTTP(S), download both through the existing guarded transport, and combine the local files with the confined ffmpeg stream-copy path. Progressive files still take precedence. Fragment manifests, DRM and unsupported codecs stay unsupported. Both network and disk limits still apply; audio or oversized mux output can fall back to a silent video. The pinned Python runtime and existing subprocess/network isolation remain unchanged.

YouTube HTTP tracks also carry a chunk-size hint from the pinned extractor. The guarded helper honors it with HTTP Range requests (at most 10 MiB each) and validates every Content-Range, total length and actual byte count. Ranges share the original network/request budget. A malformed, truncated, shifted or size-changing range removes the partial file. This avoids the whole-track transfer throttling observed during the live recovery check without increasing the 120-second deadline or enabling another downloader.
