# Foundkeep extension configuration and updates

Foundkeep uses two update paths with a strict boundary between account data and executable extension code.

## Live account controls

The dashboard stores one validated preferences document per account. Connected extensions read it over authenticated HTTPS, cache it for at most five minutes, and retain the last valid copy when offline. Saving settings from a dashboard that can detect the extension triggers an immediate revision-checked refresh.

| Area | Live controls |
| --- | --- |
| Capture methods | Page, highlight, region, full page, image, X post, note |
| Bookmark copy | Readable text, extended metadata, heading outline |
| Notes | Attach the open page as the note source |
| Popup | Secondary action order, recent section, recent item count |
| Sync | Automatic cloud upload |
| Automatic context | OCR, summaries, tags |
| Feedback | Success badge |
| Browser menus | Right-click actions |

These 20 values change extension behavior without repackaging or waiting for a store release. The server validates the exact schema before saving it. The extension validates it again before applying it. A bad response falls back to the last valid cache or built-in defaults.

## Operator controls

Foundkeep also publishes a strictly validated data-only policy at `/extension-policy.json`. It can disable any capture method, automatic sync, or browser context menus globally, and can lower the packaged limits for article text, selected text, images, full-page pixels, and full-page height. It cannot enable a feature the customer disabled, raise a packaged safety ceiling, add permissions, change network destinations, or execute code.

The extension uses a valid cached policy immediately and refreshes it every minute. On a cold or offline start it applies the bundled safe policy without delaying a local save, then refreshes in the background. Change the policy's `revision` whenever publishing a new document so an older response can never replace a newer cached revision.

## Changes that require a store release

The following are executable or privileged extension behavior and therefore ship only through a new reviewed package:

- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, or packaged assets
- Manifest permissions, host access, keyboard commands, content scripts, and externally connectable origins
- Capture algorithms, extraction fields, storage schema, encryption or authentication behavior
- New browser APIs or new kinds of network access
- The fixed Foundkeep API origin

Manifest V3 and Chrome Web Store policy prohibit using remotely hosted JavaScript or an arbitrary over-the-air code loader. Foundkeep intentionally fetches JSON account configuration only. Store updates are automatic after Google approves a new version, so customers normally do not need to update the extension by hand.

The manual self-hosted build has its own signed update channel and version history. The Chrome Web Store channel starts at `1.0.0` and omits the self-hosting `key` and `update_url` fields because Google owns signing, identity, and updates for that channel.
