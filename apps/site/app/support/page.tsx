        <ol>

          <li><strong>Let Chrome update it.</strong> The Store build starts at version 1.0.0 and receives approved updates automatically.</li>
          <li><strong>Pin Foundkeep.</strong> Open the browser’s extension menu and pin Foundkeep so the save controls stay within reach.</li>
          <li><strong>Using another Chromium browser?</strong> Edge, Brave, Opera and Vivaldi can use the manual ZIP from the <Link href="/#get">Get Foundkeep</Link> section when Store installation is unavailable.</li>

      <div className="support-answer">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Protected browser pages:</strong> browsers block extensions on pages such as <code>chrome://</code>, extension stores, and some built-in PDF viewers. Open the original website and capture there.</li>
          <li><strong>Readable page:</strong> wait for the article to finish loading, then save it again. Foundkeep stores the useful text and available page metadata; sites may omit author, dates, images, or canonical URLs.</li>
          <li><strong>Highlight:</strong> select text on the page before choosing Save highlight. If the page replaces the selection, use Save page or add a note instead.</li>
          <li><strong>Image:</strong> allow the one-time site access prompt when Foundkeep needs to fetch the original image. Denying it prevents that image from being saved.</li>
          <li><strong>Screenshot:</strong> keep the page tab active until capture finishes. Very tall or animated pages can change while a full-page screenshot is assembled.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="support-note">Every saved item keeps the strongest source record available, including the visited URL, canonical URL, title, site, capture method and capture time. Open the item details to return to its origin.</p>

      <div className="support-answer">
        <ol>
          <li>Open Foundkeep and confirm the capture appears in the extension’s local library.</li>
          <li>Check that the extension says <strong>Connected</strong> and that automatic sync is enabled in Capture settings.</li>
          <li>Leave the browser online for a moment. Pending uploads retry automatically after a connection returns.</li>
          <li>Refresh the web dashboard and confirm its signed-in email matches the extension.</li>
          <li>If the item predates the account connection, use the extension’s explicit import action. Older local captures are never uploaded without that choice.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="support-note"><strong>Deletion is separate:</strong> deleting a cloud item does not remove its local browser copy, and removing a local copy does not delete an item already synced to the cloud.</p>

      <div className="support-answer">
        <p>Choose <strong>Continue with email</strong>, then <strong>Recover your account</strong> on the <a href="/login">sign-in page</a>, then enter your account email and recovery code. Foundkeep shows the recovery code once when you create the account or change the password. It does not send password-reset emails.</p>
        <p>For Google or Apple sign-in, use the same verified email to return to your collection. Connecting the first provider to a password account asks for that password once. Apple’s Hide My Email creates a separate relay address; use your original sign-in method if you see an empty collection.</p>
        <p>Changing the password or using recovery revokes other website sessions and connected browsers. Sign in again, then reconnect each browser you still use.</p>

      <div className="support-section-heading"><h2 id="settings-support-title">Change capture behavior from your dashboard.</h2></div>
      <div className="support-answer">
        <p>Open Account &amp; settings to control capture methods, readable page extraction, metadata, note source attachment, popup order, automatic sync, OCR, summaries, and tags. In the iPhone app, Settings also controls capture-ready alerts. Connected browsers and iPhones refresh the data-only policy without a Store release.</p>
        <p>Foundkeep links can open sign-in, account recovery, the collection, Settings, a new note, or a specific capture. If the iPhone is signed out, Foundkeep asks the customer to sign in and then continues to the original safe destination. Links never contain account credentials or saved content.</p>
        <p>Browser permissions, executable extension code, iPhone native code, Share Extension capabilities and other manifest or entitlement changes arrive through signed Store updates. The iPhone interface and copy can update through EAS Update within the installed native runtime. Foundkeep’s remote policies contain data only and never download executable code.</p>
